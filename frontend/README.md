# 🌐 Translation App — Frontend (Next.js)

This is the **Next.js frontend** of the AI-powered Translation App.  
It communicates with a Java JEE backend connected to Google Gemini, providing:

- Real-time translation
- Meanings in the suggested language
- Alternative translations
- Text-to-speech support
- Automatic API health detection

## ✨ Features

### 🔤 AI Translation UI
- Clean single-page interface (`/`)
- Supports RTL/LTR text directions
- Displays translation, meanings, alternatives, and scores

### 🔁 Alternative Translations
- Shows 1–3 alternatives with accuracy scores  
- Highlights which meaning each alternative belongs to

### 🔊 Text-to-Speech Support
- Plays audio generated by the backend  
- Two buttons: *source-language audio* + *target-language audio*

### 🟢 API Status Badge
At the top of the page, the app displays the backend status.

It automatically calls: **GET `/api/isup`**


**Status meanings:**

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🟢 **API Up** | Backend + Gemini reachable |
| 🟡 **Checking…** | Connecting to backend |
| 🔴 **API Down** | Backend unreachable or CORS issue |

The translation interface only activates when the backend is up.



## 🏗️ Architecture (Frontend Side)

- Single route: **`/`**
- Central state object: `translationResponse`
- Axios API wrapper in `/lib/axios-client`
- UI built with TailwindCSS + Shadcn UI
- Audio playback via Blob conversion utilities



## 🛠️ Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm / pnpm / yarn
- A running backend server



## 🚀 Setup

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
### 2. Add an **.env** file to the frontend root with the address of the backend
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://{ip}:{port}/translation-project/api
``` 
### 3. Type **npm run dev** to launch the app
